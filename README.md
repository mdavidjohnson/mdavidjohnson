- 👋 Hi, I’m @mdavidjohnson
- 👀 I’m interested in the 64K CoCo2, the Vcc Emulator, and lots of other stuff - see www.bds-soft.com and www.theologyfrombelow.org .
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more inner-CoCo stuff, Christian Apologetics, and better ways to improve my rather poor chess skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to possibly  develop a coding learning bundle centered around Vcc . 
- 📫 How to reach me: info@bds-soft.com .
